Studies in Overtone and Clojure (and CIDER and Lein).

From that Wikipedia:

> Studies are often used to understand the problems involved in rendering subjects and to plan the elements to be used in finished works, such as light, color, form, perspective and composition.

This is a repository to house my attempts to better understand the problems involved in:

+ Overtone, and programming music in general
+ Clojure, its libraries and idioms
+ CIDER, and being productive in Clojure from within Emacs
+ Leiningen, and the ecosystem around Clojure on the JVM

It is not intended to be of much use to anyone else, but I hope to learn about these subjects so as to build something more compelling at a later point in time.
