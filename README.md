Studies in Overtone and Clojure (and CIDER and Lein).

From that Wikipedia:

> Studies are often used to understand the problems involved in
> rendering subjects and to plan the elements to be used in finished
> works, such as light, color, form, perspective and composition.

This is a repository to house my attempts to better understand the
problems involved in:

+ Overtone, and programming music in general
+ Clojure, its libraries and idioms
+ CIDER, and being productive in Clojure from within Emacs
+ Leiningen, and the ecosystem around Clojure on the JVM
+ core.async, and Communicating Sequential Processes

Originally meant as an exercise in the above topics, this repository
has evolved.

The new goal of this work is to make an automated Bot that
regularly produces generated musical compositions.
